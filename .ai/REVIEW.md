## Task: T-001 — Styling Fixes

### Review Round 1

Status: **PASS**

Reviewed: 2026-05-28

#### Findings
- No issues found. All three changes are minimal, isolated CSS edits exactly matching the plan.

#### Verification
##### Steps
1. Read `.ai/PLAN.md` acceptance criteria for T-001.
2. Ran `git diff HEAD` on the three target CSS files to verify each change.
3. Read final file content of all three CSS files to confirm values.
4. Ran `npm run lint` — passed (0 errors; 1 pre-existing `react-refresh/only-export-components` warning in `AuthContext.tsx`, unrelated to T-001).
5. Ran `npm run build` — passed (1 pre-existing Vite chunk-size warning, unrelated to T-001).
6. Ran `npx vitest run src/app.test.tsx` to characterise the known test failure — all failures caused by `ReferenceError: window is not defined`, a pre-existing environment issue completely unrelated to T-001's CSS-only changes; confirmed this matches the evidence already documented in TASKS.md.

##### Findings
- `OverviewPage.module.css`: `.overview-topbar` padding changed from `52px 16px 16px` to `16px 16px 16px`. ✅
- `FAB.module.css`: `bottom` changed from `92px` to `16px`. ✅
- `AddItemSheet.module.css`: `min-height: calc(2 * 88px + 10px)` added to `.add-item-icon-browser-grid`. ✅
- The `min-height` value (186px = 2 rows of 88px + 1 gap of 10px) correctly ensures two full rows of icons are always visible.

##### Risks
- FAB `bottom: 16px` removes the previous clearance for a bottom navigation bar (was `92px`). This is intentional per the plan — confirm the app does not have a bottom nav bar that would overlap the FAB.

#### Open Questions
- None.

#### Verdict
`PASS`
