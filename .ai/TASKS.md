# TASKS

Use this board to coordinate handoff between planner, implementer, and reviewer.

Status values:
- `in_planning`
- `ready_for_implement`
- `in_implementation`
- `ready_for_review`
- `in_review`
- `ready_to_commit`
- `changes_requested`
- `done`

Command expectations:
- planner moves tasks into `in_planning` and `ready_for_implement`
- implementer moves tasks into `in_implementation`, `ready_for_review`, and `done`, and resumes work from `changes_requested` and `ready_to_commit`
- reviewer moves tasks into `in_review`, `ready_to_commit`, or `changes_requested`
- `status_cycle` should report deterministic task status, current owner role, and next recommended action based on this board
